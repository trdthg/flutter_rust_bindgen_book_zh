# Create new projects from a template

In this chapter, we are going to use create your own project from a code template. It seems a bit long, but it is just because we have tried to describe *every detail* that you may encounter.

**Remark:** Most complexity does *not* come from this library, `flutter_rust_bridge` - it is as same complex as using raw Dart/Flutter FFI with Rust. In other words, it is the Dart/Flutter + Rust toolchain that takes time to set up.
