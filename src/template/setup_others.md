# Other platforms

For all remaining platforms, there are no required setup steps to take, apart from those listed in [Desktop support for Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/desktop). If you need to check your progress, run `flutter doctor -v` and it will display the status of your toolchain and any actionable steps. The rest of this page
documents additional hints for each of the platforms that might be useful for newcomers to
Flutter and/or Rust.
