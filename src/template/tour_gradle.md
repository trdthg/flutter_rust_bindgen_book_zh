# `android/app/build.gradle`

This file is part of the default Flutter build process for Android apps.
The template injects additional hooks to run [`cargo-ndk`](https://lib.rs/crates/cargo-ndk)
upon invoking `flutter run`. This method is explained more in detail in
[Hooking onto tasks](../integrate/android_tasks.md).
